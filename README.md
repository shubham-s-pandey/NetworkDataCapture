# NetworkDataCapture
This script automates the process of capturing network data from a list of URLs using Selenium WebDriver with Firefox. It reads URLs from a text file, navigates to each URL, waits for the page to load, and captures the network data. The captured data is immediately written to an output file after each URL is processed, ensuring that progress is saved and reducing the risk of data loss. The script uses the performance logs from the browser’s window object and filters for logs with ‘responseEnd’. This script is particularly useful for web scraping, web testing, and data analysis tasks. Additionally, it can be used to fetch API endpoints.
